**An OCaml installation is required, you can find instructions [HERE](https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html) !**


If Ocaml has been installed properly, you should not need to set an installation location in the settings.
To verify that Ocaml is properly installed, launch a terminal and type `ocaml`, it should let you in the Ocaml interpreter.


This is a requirement for Linux users !


If everything has been set-up correctly, you should see an OCaml version when opening or restarting the interpreter.
