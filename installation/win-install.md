**An OCaml installation is required, you can find instructions [HERE](https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html) !**

To properly use this plugin it is required to define where your OCaml folder is, this
can be done in the `Settings -> Tools -> OCamlJ`, from there you can either type the path to where
OCaml is installed or browse for it.

> **_IMPORTANT NOTE :_** _You must select a folder containing the following directories :_ 
> 
> `.\bin` _where ocaml.exe is installed._
> 
> `.\lib\ocaml` _where all ocaml modules are stored._

**After defining the location of OCaml, either restart IntelliJ or Restart the interpreter, see below under `Restart the OCaml Interpreter` section in actions.**

If everything has been set-up correctly, you should see an OCaml version when opening or restarting the interpreter.
