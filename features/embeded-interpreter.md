# **Embeded Interpreter**

OCamlJ comes with its main functionality, an OCaml console inside IntelliJ to make testing of statements easier and quicker.

You can find the panel at the bottom right of the IDE :

When opened and if setup correctly, you should have a panel similar to this ( colors may very depending on your theme ... )

From there you can type your OCaml commands right next to the `#` and press the `ENTER` key to submit it to the interpreter.

### Restarting the interpreter

**In case of crashing / console not linking with OCaml, you can refresh the interpreter by pressing a red refresh icon on the top right of the IDE**
