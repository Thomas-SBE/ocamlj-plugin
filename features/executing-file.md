# **Executing File**

***Shortcut :*** *Ctrl + Alt + F1*

***File avaiability :*** *`.ml`*

**Description :**

The `Execute OCaml File` action can be executed only in `.ml` files ( `.mli` files will later be available for use with OCamlJ )

Executing this action will send the content of the current file opened in the Editor to the interpreter. 

It will then display in the interpreter which file you just executed, and the response of OCaml after each statement.

> ***Note :*** *For now, it does not display the content which is sent to the interpreter, it only displays the filename for stream in/ou synchronization issues.*
